I live in Munich, work at [Brainlab](https://www.brainlab.com/) as Software Engineer. I am originally from Ankara,Turkey. I obtained my bachelor's degree in computer science from Hacettepe University. During my bachelors, I participated in Erasmus program in Germany. I was living in Freiburg im Breisgau, the heart of Black Forest, for half a year. I started my master's degree in computer science at Technical University of Munich in 2018, and completed it in 2021.

My main research interest is computer vision, in particular multiview geometry, SLAM, and sensor fusion. I like to use deep learning as a tool while tackling different types of computer vision problems. I love ROS and the things you can do with it. Currently I am working as a C++ developer. On my spare time I am learning Rust and working on some robotics side projects, while reading about how to write better C++ code and also tests.

This blog is mostly for me to keep track of what I have accomplished over the time. To share the problems I have faced while implementing new things, worth mentioning.
